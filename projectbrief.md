1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive set of guidelines for using the Maxlube brand identity. Its purpose is to ensure consistency across all communications, particularly the new website, to present a unified, professional, and recognizable brand image. Adhering to these standards will strengthen brand recognition and reinforce our values of expertise, reliability, and quality.

2. Logo

The Maxlube logo is the primary identifier of our brand. It should be used consistently and correctly in all applications.

Primary Logo

This is the standard, full-color version of the logo and should be used whenever possible.

Logo Variations

* Monochrome: For use in single-color applications where the primary logo is not suitable.
* Reversed (White): For use on dark or colored backgrounds to ensure visibility.

Clear Space & Minimum Size

* Clear Space: To ensure the logo's integrity and visibility, always maintain a minimum clear space around it. This exclusion zone should be equal to the height of the "MAX" text in the logo. No other elements (text, images, graphics) should intrude into this space.
* Minimum Size: The logo should never be reproduced at a width smaller than 100 pixels for digital applications or 2.5cm for print.

Incorrect Usage

To maintain brand consistency, never:

* Distort or stretch the logo.
* Change the logo's colors.
* Add drop shadows or other visual effects.
* Place the logo on a cluttered or visually competing background.
* Rotate the logo.
* Use an old version of the logo.
